# 🕵️ Mimic Human or AI?

**A fully on-chain "Human or AI?" chat game built on [GenLayer](https://genlayer.com).**

Chat with a stranger. It's secretly either a human-style persona or an AI  guess which.
Every reply is computed on-chain by GenLayer's AI validators. Your score and the global
leaderboard live entirely in an Intelligent Contract. No backend.

## 🎮 How it works

1. **Connect your wallet**  MetaMask, OKX, Rabby, Coinbase, or any EIP-1193 wallet
   (detected automatically via EIP-6963).
2. **Play a round**  `start_round` is payable and charges a tiny entry fee
   (**0.0001 GEN**). The contract secretly picks a persona (`human` or `ai`) via LLM
   consensus.
3. **Chat** send messages; the "stranger" replies in character. Replies are real
   on-chain transactions, so each takes a few seconds to settle.
4. **Guess**  call it **HUMAN** or **AI**. Correct = **+10**, wrong = **−5**.
5. **Leaderboard**  every player is ranked publicly by score.

## 🧠 Why GenLayer

GenLayer is an AI-native blockchain: validator nodes run LLMs and reach **Optimistic
Democracy** consensus on non-deterministic results. Mimic uses that directly — the secret
persona and every chat reply are produced by an LLM *inside the contract* and agreed on by
validators. The "answer" is on-chain the whole time; you just can't see it until you guess.

| GenLayer feature | Where it's used in [`contracts/mimic.py`](./contracts/mimic.py) |
|---|---|
| `gl.Contract` | `class Mimic(gl.Contract)` |
| `@gl.public.write.payable` + `gl.message.value` | entry fee on `start_round` |
| `gl.message.sender_address` | identifies the player |
| `gl.nondet.exec_prompt` | the LLM call (persona + replies) |
| `gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe(leader_fn, validator_fn)` | validator consensus on LLM output |
| `gl.vm.UserError` | input / state validation |
| `TreeMap[Address, …]`, `DynArray[Address]`, `u256` | on-chain game state + leaderboard |
